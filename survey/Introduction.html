        You are now participating in a decision-making experiment. Based on your decisions in this experiment, you can earn
    money that will be paid to you in cash today. It is important that you understand all instructions before making
    your choices in this experiment. If at any point you have a question, please raise your hand and we will answer
    you as soon as possible.
    <br><br>
    The experiment consists of a demographic survey and six decision-making tasks. You have already earned
    [participation payment] for agreeing to participate in the experiment, which will be paid to you in cash at the
    end of the session. In addition to this participation payment, you may earn considerably more from your choices in
    the decision-making tasks. These tasks and the potential earnings from them will be explained in detail as we
    proceed through the session.
    <br><br>
    We will begin the experiment by asking you to answer some demographic questions.  After the demographic questions,
    you will be given a task where you will be paid according to how accurate your beliefs are about certain things.
    You will be presented with six tasks. We will explain how to complete the tasks after you have filled out the
    demographic survey.
    <br><br>
    In addition to your show-up fee, you will receive the winnings from one of the questions you answer,
    selected at random, so you should think carefully about your answer to each question,
    as any question could be chosen for your payment.
