    You have 10 sliders to adjust, and have 100 tokens to allocate.
    Each slider allows you to allocate tokens to reflect your belief about the answer to this question.
    You must allocate all 100 tokens in order to submit your decision. As you allocate tokens by adjusting sliders,
    the payoffs displayed on the screen will change. Your earnings are based on the payoffs that are displayed after
    you have allocated all 100 tokens.
    Note that the payoffs shown on the screen will not be accurate unless you have allocated all 100 tokens.
    <br><br>
    Where you position each slider depends on your beliefs about the correct answer to the question.
    In the above example, the tokens you allocate to each bar will naturally reflect your beliefs about life expectancy
    in the United States. The first bar here corresponds to your belief that the average person in the United States
    lives between 0 and 10 years. The second bar corresponds to your belief that the average US citizen lives between
    11 and 20 years, and so on. Each bar here shows the amount of money you earn if the true life expectancy is in the
    interval shown under the bar.

    <p style="font-size:160%;"><b>Example 2:</b></p>
    To illustrate how you use these sliders, suppose you believe there is a fair chance the true life expectancy
    is around 71 to 80 years, but you are not absolutely sure.
    Then you might allocate the 100 tokens in the following way:
    <br><br>
•	25 tokens to the interval 61 to 70 <br>
•	50 tokens to the interval 71 to 80 <br>
•	25 tokens to the interval 81 to 90 <br><br>
The potential payoffs for this allocation are shown below:

        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-tab" data-offset="-1">Previous</button>

</div>
<div class="tab">
    <p style="font-size:160%;"><b>Example 2:</b></p>
    <img src="{{ static 'pilot_image_2.png' }}" class="center"/>
    <br>
    As you allocated the most tokens to the interval from 71 to 80, if the true answer were in this range,
    you would receive your highest potential payoff for this allocation of tokens, $16.25.
    You would earn $11.25 if the true answer is actually between 61 and 70, $11.25 if it is between 81 and 90,
    and $6.25 if the true answer is any other number.
    <br><br>
    You can adjust the tokens as much as you want to best reflect your personal beliefs about US life expectancy.
    Your earnings depend on your reported beliefs and, of course, the true answer.
    <br><br>
    For instance, in the figure shown above, the true life expectancy at birth in the United States is 77 years
    according to 2020 CDC statistics. So, if you had reported the beliefs shown above, you would have earned $16.25.

<div class="tab">
    <p style="font-size:160%;"><b>Example 3:</b></p>
    Suppose you had “put all of your eggs in one basket”,
    and for example allocated 100 tokens to the interval corresponding to 71 to 80.
    Then you would have faced the earnings outcomes shown below,
    and earned $20, as the true answer is 77.
    Note, if you had instead allocated all 100 tokens to any one other bin, your payoff would have been $0.

<div class="tab">
    <p style="font-size:160%;"><b>Example 4:</b></p>
    Now, suppose you think life expectancy in the United States is between 51 and 90 years,
    but among these answers,
    you are not sure any one bin from 51 to 90 is more likely to contain the true answer than another.
    In that case, you might allocate 25 tokens to each of the four bins that span 51 to 90 years.
    In this case, your potential payoffs would be below, and you would have earned $12.50.

    Using the information you provided in the demographic survey,
    questions will be asked using statistical estimates based on people like you.
    For example, instead of being asked about the life expectancy for all people in the United States,
    you might be asked about the average life expectancy among all people in the United States who share your
    gender, age group, and BMI.
    <br><br>
    It is up to you to balance the strength of your personal beliefs with the risk of them being wrong.
    There are three important points for you to keep in mind when making your decisions:
    <br><br>
•	Your belief about the correct answer to each question is a personal judgment that depends on your
    own knowledge and understanding.<br>
•	Depending on your choices and the correct answer, you can earn up to $20.<br>
•	Your choices might also depend on your willingness to take risks or to gamble.
    <br><br>
    The decisions you make are a matter of personal choice.
    Please work silently, and make your choices by thinking carefully about the questions you are presented with.
    <br><br>
    When you are happy with your decisions, you should click on the Submit button and confirm your choices.
    After each question, the correct bin will be revealed to you,
    and your potential payoff for that question will be displayed.
    After all questions are completed, one question will be chosen at random for payment.
    <br><br>
    All payoffs are in cash, and are in addition to the show-up fee that you receive just for being here.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions about the upcoming tasks, please either review the previous information provided here,
    or raise your hand and ask an experimenter. If you fully understand the instructions, please continue onto the
    decision-making tasks.
